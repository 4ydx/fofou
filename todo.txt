This project grew out of my desire to replace PHP-based FruitShow forum for
my Sumatra PDF viewer with Google App Engine-based solution.

It works, it can be used for hosting your own forums and I'm using it myself.

Of course, there's always something to improve and below is my whishlist. I'm
sure you'll have no trouble coming up with your own list of possible
improvements.

TODO must have:
 - cookies for anonymous users seem te be messed up (or I'm filling out
   post form based on a wrong cookie). When not logged in, replying
   to a post fills out user info based on the orignal poster, not the
   person who's replying

TODO nice to have:
 - comment count should only count non-deleted posts
 - ip address blocking
 - mass delete of posts from a given ip address and/or user account
 - use ajax google search ui 
 - finish /<forumurl>/email?post_id=<post_id>
 - admin features like blocking users (ip address, cookie, user_id)
   and not adding if a Post with this body_sha1 already exists
 - better anti-spam protection (akismet? captcha?)

TODO low priority:
 - more templates and ability to choose a template in /manageforums
 - /rsscombined - all posts for all forums, for forum admins mostly
 - cache main page in memcached, similar to rss feeds
 - cookie validation
 - alternative forms of integration with a website (iframe? return data
   as json and do most of the rendering using javascript?)
 - document importing posts from fruitshow database
