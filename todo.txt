This project grew out of my desire to replace PHP-based FruitShow forum for
my Sumatra PDF viewer with Google App Engine-based solution.

It works, it can be used for hosting your own forums and I'm using it myself.

Of course, there's always something to improve and below is my whishlist. I'm
sure you'll have no trouble coming up with your own list of possible
improvements.

TODO:
 - fix cookie expire time as in https://github.com/solsticedhiver/fofou/commit/19b864fde9e0ba3fc9f24e2bb4b11a7408385778

TODO nice to have:
 - use self.request.remote_addr instead of os.environ['REMOTE_ADDR'] as in
  https://github.com/solsticedhiver/fofou/commit/0f2b8a46435fa056cc93052ea929db5819eb9b2c
 - unchecking 'remember me' on post doesn't seem to make us forget
 - comment count should only count non-deleted posts
 - mass delete of posts from a given ip address and/or user account
 - use ajax google search ui 
 - finish /<forumurl>/email?post_id=<post_id>
 - admin features like blocking users (ip address, cookie, user_id)
   and not adding if a Post with this body_sha1 already exists
 - better anti-spam protection (akismet? captcha?)

TODO low priority:
 - more templates and ability to choose a template in /manageforums
 - /rsscombined - all posts for all forums, for forum admins mostly
 - cache main page in memcached, similar to rss feeds
 - cookie validation
 - alternative forms of integration with a website (iframe? return data
   as json and do most of the rendering using javascript?)
 - ip address blocking
