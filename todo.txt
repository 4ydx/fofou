This project grew out of my desire to replace PHP-based FruitShow forum for
my Sumatra PDF viewer with Google App Engine-based solution.

It works, it can be used for hosting your own forums and I'm using it myself.

Of course, there's always something to improve and below is my whishilist. I'm
sure you'll have no trouble coming up with your own list of possible
improvements.

TODO must have: nothing

TODO nice to have:
 - use ajax google search ui 
 - finish /<forumurl>/email?post_id=<post_id>
 - admin features like blocking users (ip address, cookie, user_id)
   and not adding if a Post with this body_sha1 already exists
 - better anti-spam protection (akismet? captcha?)

TODO low priority:
 - more templates and ability to choose a template in /manageforums
 - /rsscombined - all posts for all forums, for forum admins mostly
 - cache generated rss feeds using memcached and invalidate them when
   there's a new post (invalidate /rss and /rssall feed) or new topic
   (invalidate only /rss; also on post delete/undelete)
 - cookie validation
 - alternative forms of integration with a website (iframe? return data
   as json and do most of the rendering using javascript?)
 - document process of importing posts from fruitshow
