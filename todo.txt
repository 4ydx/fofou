This project grew out of my desire to replace PHP-based FruitShow forum for
my Sumatra PDF viewer with Google App Engine-based solution, hence all the
TODO items here are things that I personally want to improve.

But it's also your project, by the virtue of being open-source, so feel free
to add any features that *you* want.

TODO must have:
 - hookup sumatra forums at fofou.org
TODO less urgent:
 - finish /<forumurl>/email?post_id=<post_id>
 - use ajax google search ui 
 - prevent dups by doing sha1 on post body, remembering it in Post.body_sha1
 - admin features like blocking users (ip address, cookie, user_id)
   and not adding if a Post with this body_sha1 already exists
 - js to show full url when typing url when creating new forum
Maybe:
 - 
 - more templates and ability to choose a template in /manageforums
 - /rsscombined - all posts for all forums, for forum admins mostly
 - cache generated rss feeds using memcached and invalidate them when
   there's a new post (invalidate /rss and /rssall feed) or new topic
   (invalidate only /rss; also on post delete/undelete)
 - cookie validation
 - alternative forms of integration with a website (iframe? return data
   as json and do most of the rendering using javascript?)
